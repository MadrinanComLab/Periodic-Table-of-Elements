				<h2>Characteristics</h2>

				<p>When a second proton and two neutrons are added to a hydrogen nucleus, a helium atom can form after it collects two electrons. Helium is the most inert of all the noble group 18 gases. It is so inactive that it does not even combine with itself. As a gas, helium remains as a single atom. The nuclei of helium are called <b>alpha particles</b>, each of which has a charge of +2 and an atomic mass of 4.</p>

				<p>No stable compound of helium has ever been found. However, it is possible for an atom of hydrogen to combine with helium (and other light noble elements) under special conditions to form HeH<sup>+</sup>, an unstable ion.</p>

				<p>Helium is not plentiful on Earth and is only the sixth most abundant gas in the atmosphere. It does not accumulate in the atmosphere because it is lighter than air. Some amount of helium continually escapes into space from the outer atmosphere of the Earth.</p>

				<p>Liquid helium exhibits some unusual characteristics when supercooled. First, it is the only element that will not turn into a solid by just using pressure. Heat must be removed as the pressure is increased, but helium will freeze at –272.2°C, which is the lowest temperature scientists have ever achieved. Second, it is an excellent conductor of heat. As a supercold liquid, it will move toward heat—even flow up the sides and over the top of a container.</p>

			<h2>Abundance and Source</h2>

			<p>Helium is the 73<sup>rd</sup> most abundant element on Earth, but it is the second most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen. Together, helium and hydrogen make up 99.9% of all the elements in the universe, but helium makes up only a small trace of the elements on Earth.</p>

			<p>Most likely, helium was the first element to be formed after hydrogen during the Big Bang formation of the universe. The theory is that hydrogen atoms combined under great heat and pressure to form helium atoms. The Earth’s current helium originally came from the natural decay of radioactive elements deep in the Earth. Much of it seeps up to the surface and escapes into the atmosphere, or it mixes with natural gas deposits deep in the Earth. Like hydrogen, it is a very light gas that escapes through cracks in the Earth’s crust and sooner or later escapes from Earth’s gravity into the atmosphere.</p>

			<p>Helium can be obtained from the atmosphere by lowering the temperature of air until it liquefies. All the other gases in air will turn to a liquid except helium, because it has the lowest boiling point. Since helium, at this stage of cooling, will be the only vapor left, it can be removed as a pure gas. It is commercially more profitable to produce helium by separating it from a mix of natural underground gases, where its concentration is greater that in the atmosphere. Raw natural gas is a mixture of methane, nitrogen, and helium, with traces of other gases. The nitrogen and helium are separated from the methane, which is used as a fuel. This separation is accomplished by fractional distillation wherein the temperature is reduced and the gases are liquefied. As the temperature is reduced, methane is liquefied first, then nitrogen, leaving helium to be collected and sold commercially. Helium is produced in Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Canada by liquefying natural gas and “boiling off” the other gases. Helium is then purified to 99.995%. Amarillo, Texas, is one of the major centers for the production of helium in the United States. Over three billion cubic feet of helium is produced in the United States, where there is a military-reserve “storage” supply in natural caverns of over 32 billion cubic feet of helium. Most of the world’s supply of helium comes from the United States.

			<h2>Hazards</h2>

			<p>Being inert, the noble gases are nontoxic. However, they can act as <b>asphyxiant</b> gases that can kill because of oxygen deprivations.</p>

			<p>A possible hazard is when He<sup>++</sup> nuclei, as alpha particles, are accelerated to high speeds and bombard a target. Alpha particles can be stopped by several inches of air or a piece of cardboard. As high-energy, charged particles generated from man-made or natural radioactivity, alpha particles can cause damage, but they are not as damaging to our bodies as are very short wavelength <b>gamma rays</b>, which can only be stopped by lead shielding.</p>
