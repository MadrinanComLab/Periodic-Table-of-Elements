				<h2>Characteristics</h2>

				<p>H<sub>2</sub> is a diatomic gas molecule composed of two tightly joined atoms that strongly share their outer electrons. It is an odorless, tasteless, and colorless gas lighter than air. Hydrogen is included in group 1 with the alkali metals because it has an oxidation state of +1 as do the other alkali metals. Experiments during the 1990s at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), in Livermore, California, lowered the temperature of H<sub>2</sub> to almost absolute zero. By exploding gunpowder in a long tube that contained gaseous hydrogen, the gas that was under pressure of over one million times the normal atmospheric pressure was compressed into a liquid. This extreme pressure on the very cold gas converted it to liquid hydrogen (almost to the point of solid metallic hydrogen), in which state it did act as a metal and conduct electricity.</p>
			
				<p>Hydrogen gas is slightly soluble in water, alcohol, and ether. Although it is noncorrosive, it can permeate solids better than air. Hydrogen has excellent <b>adsorption</b> capabilities in the way it attaches and holds to the surface of some substances. (Adsorption is not the same as <b>absorption</b> with a “b,” in which one substance intersperses another.)

			<h2>Abundance and Source</h2>

			<p>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. For every carbon atom in the universe, there are about 12,000 hydrogen atoms. On Earth, hydrogen is only the 10th most abundant element and occurs mainly in a combined form as water, and oxygen is the most abundant element on Earth. Hydrogen is also found in organic and hydrocarbon compounds. Only traces of hydrogen are found in the atmosphere. Because hydrogen gas is lighter than air, it escapes from Earth’s gravity into outer space</p>

			<p>Hydrogen may have been formed by the “big bang” at the beginning of the universe about 13 to 15 billion years ago, accounting for over 98% of all the atoms in existence at this explosive event. Today hydrogen makes up over 90% of all the atoms and about 75% of the entire weight (mass) of the universe. The “big bang” is only one theory for the origin of the universe, but it is the one with the most current and persuasive evidence, and it argues that billions of years ago, an incredibly small, but dense, ball or point of matter, or energy, exploded, dispersing matter and energy in an ever-expanding three-dimensional pattern. Astronomical observations indicate that the universe continues to expand. The energy and hydrogen produced by the big bang are thought to be the building blocks of matter and sources of all energy in the current universe, including the solar system and Earth.</p>

			<p>There is some evidence that the larger planets such as Jupiter and Saturn are composed of several gases, mainly hydrogen. Because of their size, the internal pressure is about 100 million times that of Earth’s normal air pressure, which is strong enough to compress hydrogen gas to a <b>liquid</b> phase, under which conditions it then takes on characteristics of a metallic conductor. The rotation of the planets around their liquid hydrogen cores may be responsible for the large magnetic fields and radio emissions of these large planets.</p>

			<h2>Hazards</h2>

			<p>Hydrogen gas is very explosive when mixed with oxygen gas and touched off by a spark or flame. On May 6, 1937, the German rigid-frame dirigible or zeppelin, <i>Hindenburg</i>, which was inflated with hydrogen, exploded while landing at Lakehurst, New Jersey. The explosion killed thirty-six people and injured many more when the dirigible attempted to land during a thunder and lightning storm. Many hydrides of hydrogen are dangerous and can become explosive if not stored and handled correctly.</p>

			<p>Many organic and hydrocarbon compounds are essential for life to exist, but just as many are poisonous, carcinogenic, or toxic to living organisms.</p>
