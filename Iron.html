			<h2>Characteristics</h2>

			<p>Iron is the only metal that can be tempered (hardened by heating, then quenching in water or oil). Iron can become too hard and develop stresses and fractures. This can be corrected by annealing, a process that heats the iron again and then holds it at that temperature until the stresses are eliminated. Iron is a good conductor of electricity and heat. It is easily magnetized, but its magnetic properties are lost at high temperatures. Iron has four allotropic states. The alpha form exists at room temperatures, while the other three allotropic forms exist at varying higher temperatures.</p>

			<p>Iron is the most important construction metal. It can be alloyed with many other metals to make a great variety of specialty products. Its most important alloy is steel.</p>

			<p>An interesting characteristic of iron is that it is the heaviest element that can be formed by fusion of hydrogen in the sun and similar stars. Hydrogen nuclei can be “squeezed” in the sun to form all the elements with atomic numbers below cobalt (<sub>27</sub>Co), which includes iron. It requires the excess fusion energy of supernovas (exploding stars) to form elements with proton numbers greater than iron (<sub>26</sub>Fe).</p>

			<h2>Abundance and Source</h2>

			<p>Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust (about 5%) and is the ninth most abundant element found in the sun and stars in the universe. The core of the Earth is believed to consist of two layers, or spheres, of iron. The inner core is thought to be molten iron and nickel mixture, and the outer core is a transition phase of iron with the molten magma of the Earth’s mantle.</p>

			<p>Iron’s two oxide compounds (ferrous(II) oxide—FeO) and (ferric(III) oxide—Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) are the third and seventh most abundant compounds found in the Earth’s crust</p>

			<p>The most common ore of iron is hematite that appears as black sand on beaches or black seams when exposed in the ground. Iron ores (ferric oxides) also vary in color from brownishred to brick red to cherry red with a metallic shine. Small amounts of iron and iron alloys with nickel and cobalt were found in meteorites (siderite) by early humans. This limited supply was used to shape tools and crude weapons.</p>

			<p>sed to shape tools and crude weapons. Even though small amounts of iron compounds and alloys are found in nature (iron is not found in its pure metallic state in nature), early humans did not know how to extract iron from ores until well after they knew how to smelt gold, tin, and copper ores. From these metals, they then developed bronze alloy—thus the Bronze Age (about 8000 BCE). It is assumedthat the reason iron was not more widely used is that early humans were unable to make fires hot enough to smelt the iron for it ores. There was a long transition period form the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. It is generally assumed that the Iron Age did not arrive until about 1900BCE, during the height of the Bronze Age, and iron was not the primary metal extracted by early humans until about 1000 BCE or later.</p>

			<p>There are several grades of iron ores, including hematite (brown ferric oxide) and limonite (red ferric oxide). Other ores are pyrites, chromite, magnetite, siderite, and low-grade taconite. Magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is the magnetic iron mineral/ore found in South Africa, Sweden, and parts of the United States. The “lodestone,” a form of magnetite, is a natural magnet.</p>

			<p>Iron ores are found in many countries. A major but diminishing source in the United States is the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, which has produced over two billion tons of ore since it was first opened in 1884. Iron ores are also found in Alabama and Pennsylvania. Iron is found throughout most of the universe, in most of the stars, and in our sun, and it probably exists on the other planets of our solar system.</p>

			<h2>Hazards</h2>

			<p>Iron dust from most iron compounds is harmful if inhaled and toxic if ingested. Iron dust and powder (even filings) are flammable and can explode if exposed to an open flame. As mentioned, excessive iron in the diet may cause liver damage.</p>
