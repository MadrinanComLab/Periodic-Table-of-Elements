				<h2>Characteristics</h2>

				<p>Mercury is located in group 12 (IIB) below Zn and Cd. Even though mercury is at the end of the third series of transition elements, it is not always considered one of the transition elements.</p>

				<p>Mercury forms alloys, called amalgams, with other metals such as gold, silver, zinc, and cadmium. It is not soluble in water, but will dissolve in nitric acid. It has a high electric conductivity, making it useful in the electronics industry. However, unlike most other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat. Because of its high surface tension, it does not “wet” the surfaces that it touches. This characteristic also accounts for its breakup into tiny droplets when poured over a surface. If spilled, it should not be collected with bare hands, but with a thin piece of cardboard to scoop it up.</p>

				<h2>Abundance and Source</h2>

				<p>Mercury is the 68th most abundant element. Although it can occur in its natural state, it is more commonly found as a sulfide of mercury. Its chief ore is cinnabar (HgS), which sometimes is called “vermilion” due to its red color. Historically, cinnabar was used as a red pigment. Today it is mined in Italy, Spain, and California. The best-known mercury mine is located at Almaden, Spain. It has been in continuous operation since 400 BCE.</p>

			<p>Mercury is also found in black metacinnabar and mercury chloride. Small liquid droplets of mercury may be visible in high-grade deposits. Mercury ores are also found in Algeria, Mexico, Bosnia, and Canada as well as in Spain and California</p>

			<h2>Hazards</h2>

			<p>Mercury metal is a very toxic and accumulative poison (it is not easily eliminated by the body). When inhaled as vapors, ingested as the metal or as part of a compound, or even absorbed when in contact with the skin, it can build up to deadly amounts. The fumes of most compounds are poisonous and must be avoided. Anyone who ingests mercury should contact a poison center immediately</p>

			<p>If mercury metal is spilled, it needs to be carefully gathered so as not to spread the little globs, but rather combine them for easy collection.</p>

			<p>Many patients are having the mercury amalgams that were used as dental fillings replaced because of their potential toxicity. There are conflicting data concerning the extent of risk resulting from the dental use of mercury amalgams, but there is some evidence that bacteria in saliva of the mouth may leach out traces of mercury from the amalgam. Regardless, different metals and plastics are preferred for use today to fill dental cavities.</p>

			<p>Another danger is the waste mercury that has been deposited by industries and agricultural chemicals in the lakes and oceans of the world. Several decades ago most of the nations of the world approved an international ban on dumping mercury into our waterways and oceans. The problem is that smaller ocean plants and animals consume mercury. Larger fish consume the mercury, and then we consume the larger animals. In turn, we receive an abundance of accumulated mercury that has built up in our seafood chain. Most nations, including the United States, have banned the use of mercury in agricultural chemicals, including most pesticides and insecticides. In addition to being poisonous, some compounds of mercury (mercury fulminate) are extremely explosive.</p>

			<p>Mercury can be a cumulative poison, which means that minor amounts absorbed over long periods of time build up until damage to internal organs occurs. Years ago, a mercury compound was used in the manufacturing process of felt hats. Workers who came in contact with the mercury developed a variety of medical problems, including the loss of hair and teeth and loss of memory along with general deterioration of the nervous and other systems. This became known as the “mad as a hatter” syndrome because of the afflicted individuals’ odd behavior.</p>
