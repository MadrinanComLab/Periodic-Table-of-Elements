# Periodic-Table-of-Elements
- This is my HTML project from my first year in college.
- You can observe that there are so many HTML files in this project. That is because for every element there is a dedicated HTML file for it.
- The professor restricts my class and I from using JavaScript. I could have minimized the HTML files if the prof allowed us to.
