				<h2>Characteristics</h2>

				<p>Oxygen is, without a doubt, the most essential element on Earth. It is required to support all plant and animal life, and it forms more compounds with other elements than any other element.</p>

				<p>Oxygen is soluble in both water and alcohol. Contrary to what many people believe, oxygen is NOT combustible (it will not burn), but rather it actively supports the combustion of many other substances. After all, if oxygen burned, every time a fire was lit, all the O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere would be consumed!</p>

				<p>Burning is a form of oxidation wherein oxygen chemically combines with a substance rapidly enough to produce adequate heat to cause fire and light, or to maintain a fire once started.</p>

				<p>The oxidation of iron is called rusting. Rusting in an example of “slow oxidation,” which is the reaction of O<sub>2</sub> with Fe to form Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This chemical reaction is so slow that the heat it produces is dissipated; thus, there is no fire.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Recently a new allotrope of oxygen was discovered. When O<sub>2</sub> is subjected to great pressure, it is converted into O<sub>4</sub>, which is a deep red solid that is a much more powerful oxidizer than the other forms of oxygen.</p>

			<h2>Abundance and Source</h2>

			<p>Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe, making up nearly half the mass of the Earth’s crust and nine-tenths of the total mass of water. Even the mass of our bodies consists of two-thirds oxygen. Oxygen is also the most abundant element in the Earth’s atmosphere at 20.947% by volume.</p>

			<p>Oxygen is produced commercially by liquefying air under reduced temperatures and increased pressure. Then oxygen (and other gases) can be collected as the temperature rises in the liquid air, allowing the various gases to boil off at their specific boiling points. This process is known as <b>fractional distillation</b>. Liquid air can be transported in vacuum vessels in the liquid form as long as there is a small vent to allow the escape of some of the gas that boils away as temperatures rise above the boiling point.</p>

			<p>Fractional distillation is based on the principle that each element has its own temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas. Thus, any gas can be separated from other liquefied components of air and then collected. The same process is used in the petroleum industry to separate various fractions from the crude oil.</p>

			<p>There are several methods of producing oxygen gas in the laboratory.</p>

			<p>Oxygen can be produced by electrolysis of water using a salt as an electrolyte that produces hydrogen at the opposite electrode. When potassium chlorate (KClO<sub>3</sub>) is heated in a test tube with a small amount of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) as a catalyst, the chemical reaction that releases the oxygen from potassium chlorate will be accelerated. Use of potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>) will also produce small amounts of oxygen.</p>

			<p>A recent, and more productive, method is to pass air through fine molecular-size sieves of material that will absorb the nitrogen gas of air, which then allows the oxygen gas to pass through the sieve to be collected.</p>

			<h2>Hazards</h2>

			<p>Although oxygen itself is not flammable or explosive, as is sometimes believed, its main hazard is that, in high concentrations, oxygen can cause other materials to burn much more rapidly.</p>

			<p>Oxygen is toxic and deadly to breathe when in a pure state at elevated pressures. In addition, such pure oxygen promotes rapid combustion and can produce devastating fires, such as the fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew on a test launch pad in 1967. It spread rapidly because the pure oxygen was at normal pressure rather than the one-third pressure used during flight.</p>

			<p>Oxygen used for therapeutic purposes in adults can cause <b>convulsions</b> if the concentration is too high. At one time, high levels of oxygen were given to premature infants to assist their breathing. It was soon discovered that a high concentration of O<sub>2</sub> caused blindness in some of the infants. This practice has been abandoned, or the oxygen levels have since been reduced, and this is no longer a medical problem.</p>

			<p>Oxygen involved in metabolic processes are prone to form “<b>free radicals</b>,” which are thought to cause damage to cells and possibly be associated with cancer and aging</p>
