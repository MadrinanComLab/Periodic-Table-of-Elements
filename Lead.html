				<h2>Characteristics</h2>

				<p>Although lead can be found as a metal in the Earth’s crust, it is usually mined and refined from minerals and ores. Lead is one of the most common and familiar metallic elements known. Although it is somewhat scarce, found at proportions of 13 ppm, it is still more prevalent than many other metals. Lead is <b>noncombustible</b>. and it resists corrosion</p>

				<p>When lead, which is very soft, is freshly cut, it has shiny blue-white sheen, which soon oxidizes into its familiar gray color. Lead is extremely malleable and ductile and can be worked into a variety of shapes. It can be formed into sheets, pipes, buckshot, wires, and powder. Although lead is a poor conductor of electricity, its high density makes it an excellent shield for protection from radiation, including X-rays and gamma rays.</p>

				<h2>Abundance and Source</h2>

				<p>Lead is the 35<sup>th</sup> most abundant element on Earth. Although it has been found in its free elemental metal state, it is usually obtained from a combination of the following ores: galena (PbS), anglesite (PbSO<sub>4</sub>), cerussite (PbCO<sub>3</sub>), and minum (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Lead ores are located in Europe (Germany, Rumania, and France), Africa, Australia, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, and Canada. The largest deposits of lead in the United States are in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Montana.</p>
			</div>

			<p>One of the most famous mining towns is the high-altitude western city of Leadville, Colorado. The boom started with the gold rush of the 1860s, followed by silver mining in the 1870s and 1880s. Today, this city is the site of mining operations not only for lead, but also for zinc and molybdenum. At the height of its fame, Leadville had a population of almost 50,000 people. Today the population is about 2,500.</p>

			<p>Lead is commonly obtained by roasting galena (PbS) with carbon in an oxygen-rich environment to convert sulfide ores to oxides and by then reducing the oxide to metallic lead. Sulfur dioxide gas is produced as a waste product. Large amounts of lead are also recovered by recycling lead products, such as automobile lead-acid electric storage batteries. About onethird of all lead used in the United States has been recycled.</p>

			<h2>Hazards</h2>

			<p>Lead is probably one of the most widely distributed poisons in the world. Not only is the metal poisonous, but most lead compounds are also extremely toxic when inhaled or ingested. A few, such as lead alkalis, are toxic when absorbed through skin contact.</p>

			<p>Workers in industries using lead are subject to testing of their blood and urine to determine the levels of lead in their bodies’ organs. Great effort is made to keep the workers safe.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, many older homes (built prior to 1950) have several coats of lead-based paints that flake off, which then may be ingested by children, causing various degrees of lead poisoning, including mental retardation or even death.</p>

			<p>Young children are more susceptible to an accumulation of lead in their systems than are adults because of their smaller body size and more rapidly growing organs, such as the kidneys, nervous system, and blood-forming organs. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, insomnia, and stupor, leading to coma and eventually death.</p>

			<p>Lead poisoning can also occur from drinking tap water contained in pipes that have been soldered with lead-alloy solder. This risk can be reduced by running the tap water until it is cold, which assures a fresher supply of water</p>

			<p>Another hazardous source of lead is pottery that is coated with a lead glaze that is not stabilized. Acidic and hot liquids (citrus fruits, tea, and coffee) react with the lead, and each use adds a small amount of ingested lead that can be accumulative. Lead air pollution is still a problem, but not as great as before, given that tetraethyl lead is no longer used in gasoline. However, lead air pollution remains a problem for those living near lead smelting operations or in countries where leaded gasoline is still permitted.</p>

			<p>Even though lead and many of its compounds are toxic and carcinogenic, our lives would be much less satisfying without its use in our civilization.</p>
